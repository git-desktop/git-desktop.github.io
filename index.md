## About GitHub Desktop installation

You can install GitHub Desktop on supported operating systems, which currently include macOS 12.0 or later and Windows 10 64-bit or later. If you have a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account, you can connect your account to GitHub Desktop. For more information about creating an account, see [Creating an account on GitHub](https://github.com).  
If you are a network administrator, you can deploy GitHub Desktop to computers running Windows on an Active Directory–managed network by using the Windows Installer package file (`.msi`) with Group Policy or another remote installation system.  
The Windows Installer package extracts the standalone installer (`.exe`) and configures Windows to install GitHub Desktop the next time a user signs in to their workstation. Users must have permissions to install GitHub Desktop in their user directory.  
If a user runs the Windows Installer package for GitHub Desktop directly, to complete the installation, the user must sign out of their workstation and then sign back in.
